Do I calculate everything in nominal or real amounts? If I put withdrawals AND returns in real amounts, it will mean more when I look at it. Sure!

But it will make it difficult to use other withdrawal methods, right? If I want to withdrawl 4% of my total portfolio, for example....

No, because NPV formulas usually expect real constant dollars, I think

Except we recalcuate every time.

Hmmmmmmm......



- [ ] Calculate final amount for a 30y retirement starting at the beginning. If you spend 4% inflation adjusted. 100% stocks. No rebalancing
- [ ] Changing the date range. Some people only go back to 72.

- [ ] Find longer / better data. This isn't nearly enough for backtesting
